# Where should I start?
In this lecture we will use Google Colab.  
This way you don't need to set up things to start Python programming.  
We will talk about these things later on.

## How to open Colab?
To run your own Google Colab, open your Google Drive, and just click "New" and drop the menu down to "More" and then select "Colaboratory".
